## Problem Statement
Given a directed graph, find out if a vertex v is reachable from another vertex u for all vertex pairs (u, v) in the given graph. Here reachable mean that there is a path from vertex u to v. The reach-ability matrix is called transitive closure of a graph.

---
## How to use code
First Step is to Download/clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/shyamTayal/daa_assign_6
```

---
### Run the Code

Change directory to the solution folder
```
cd daa_assign_6/Solution/
g++ closure_dfs.cpp -o dfs
./dfs
```

#### Output (by Solution files)
Testcase - 1 
```
Enter the number of node : 4
Enter the number of edges : 5
0 1
0 2
1 2
2 0
2 3

****************** Reachability matrix ********************
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 1 1
0 0 0 1

***********************************************************

Enter the number of queries to check if v can reach u : 3
Enter the pair (v,u) to check if node v can reach node u : 2 1
Yes, 2 can reach 1
Enter the pair (v,u) to check if node v can reach node u : 3 0
No, 3 cannot reach 0
Enter the pair (v,u) to check if node v can reach node u : 1 3
Yes, 1 can reach 3
```

#### Personalised Initialization Method (optional)
Change Directory to Testing Directory 
```
cd daa_assign_6/testing/
g++ testcase_gen.cpp -o inp
./inp
```
Above commands will create 1 testing file :
- input_testcase.txt 

Above testing file contains graph input for 100 testcases with with value of No. of nodes ranging from 20 to 220 and No. of edges ranging from 10 to 2010 

---
### Testing
Testing files have already been added so above step can be skipped. To be run in Testing Directory

#### Test Flloyd Warshal Algorithm 
```
g++ test_flloyd -o flloyd
./floyyd
```

#### Test DFS Algorithm 
```
g++ test_dfs -o dfs
./floyyd
```

- Both Above commands create two files one containing the reachability matrix generated by the input graph and other containing the Time complexity calculation data.

## Theory
-Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
The Floyd Warshall Algorithm is for solving the All Pairs Shortest Path problem. The problem is to find shortest distances between every pair of vertices in a given edge weighted directed Graph.
